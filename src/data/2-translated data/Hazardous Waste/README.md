This folder contains all the cleaned datasets of Hazardous Waste. The files have been translated and cleaned. 

Here are the descriptions of each file :
I created 2 more CSV files out of the original raw file to make the EDA process easier later on:

1. 32151-0001 - Hazardous Waste-producers-quantities-years-industry-types of waste(EAV 2)
2. 32151-0001 - Yearly Sum of Waste Quantities by Industries - Hazardous Waste-producers-quantities-years-industry-types of waste(EAV 2).csv
3. 32151-0001 - Yearly Sum of Waste Quantity per EAV code - Hazardous Waste-producers-quantities-years-industry-types of waste(EAV 2).csv

4. 32151 - 0002 - Hazardous Waste-producers-quantities-years-types of waste(EAV 2 and 6 digits)
