# Waste Management Model

In this project, we harness the power of data science and machine learning algorithm to predict various aspects of waste management. Waste management is a critical concern in our modern world, as the amount of waste generated continues to grow. To address this issue efficiently and sustainably, predictive modeling plays a vital role. This predictive model aims to revolutionize waste management by leveraging data-driven insights to predict future waste.


## Problem Statement
Forecast future waste generation: Develop predictive models using time series analysis or machine learning algorithms to forecast future waste generation trends, aiding in capacity planning and resource allocation.
