# Berlin-Chapter-Challenge-Developing a Data-Driven Model for Waste Management Optimization

The local problem we are trying to solve is the suboptimal waste management practices and the lack of data-driven decision-making in our community. We aim to tackle issues such as inefficient waste treatment, limited recycling rates, and environmental impact caused by improper waste disposal. By harnessing the potential of data science, we can identify opportunities for improvement, optimize waste treatment methods, and ultimately enhance the sustainability of our local waste management system.

## Problem Statements
### 1. Optimize waste composition analysis:
 Develop data-driven models to categorize waste types and identify dominant categories, enabling targeted recycling and reduction strategies.
### 2. Forecast future waste generation: 
Develop predictive models using time series analysis or machine learning algorithms to forecast future waste generation trends, aiding in capacity planning and resource allocation.
### 3. Geospatial Analysis: 
Use geographic data to create maps that display waste collection points, disposal sites, and processing facilities. This can help in route optimization and site selection.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Have a Look at the [project structure](#project-structure) and [folder overview](#folder-overview) below to understand where to store/upload your contribution
- If you're creating a task, Go to the task folder and create a new folder with the below naming convention and add a README.md with task details and goals to help other contributors understand
    - Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)_  ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
    - Create a README.md with a table containing information table about all contributions for the task.
- If you're contributing for a task, please make sure to store in relavant location and update the README.md information table with your contribution details.
- Make sure your File names(jupyter notebooks, python files, data sheet file names etc) has proper naming to help others in easily identifing them.
- Please restrict yourself from creating unnessesary folders other than in 'tasks' folder (as above mentioned naming convention) to avoid confusion.
